# Krita Export Region
Adds an "Export Region..." option to the file menu that allows you to only export the contents of a selected region. If no region is selected, then it will crop the image to fit the bounds of the currently selected layer.

## Examples
Running "Export Region..." with an area selected will export an image cropped to the selected area, like this:
